- Add more tests
- GUI?
- Enumeration
- Loading examples
- Unicode symbols
- Asymmetrical branch concurrency tau-checking (will a top level branch match tau from left right to right left?)
- Fix table reversibility
- Figure out what to do with LabelKey hash function or key generation
-- Decide what to do about the tree
